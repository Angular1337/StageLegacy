          &emsp;&emsp;Age restrictions are an important aspect that
          regulates access to various types of content and services. They
are designed to protect minors from information or
actions that may have a negative impact on their development and
          mental health. In most countries, there are legislative
          standards defining the minimum age for access to films,
          video games, Internet content, and other entertainment materials.
          For example, movies can have ratings such as G (general access), PG
          (parental control is recommended), R (restricted access) and NC-17
(not allowed for persons under 17 years of age). These ratings help
          Parents and guardians should make informed decisions about what can be done.
          show it to the children. Video games also have their own age ratings.,
          such as ESRB in the USA or PEGI in Europe. These assessment systems
          inform players about the content of the game, including the presence of violence,
          profanity or sexual content. In the Internet
          age restrictions may apply to social media and
          online services. For example, many platforms require that
          users were over 13 years old to meet the requirements
          The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States.
          It is important to remember that age restrictions are not just for protection.
          for children, but also to ensure a safe and comfortable environment for all
          users. Parents and guardians play a key role in monitoring
          access to content, as well as in teaching children critical perception
          information and responsibility in the use of technology.
