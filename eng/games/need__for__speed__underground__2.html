            <p class="main__content__top__text">&emsp;&emsp;Need for Speed: Underground 2 is a Need for Speed arcade car racing video game developed by EA Black Box Studio and published by Electronic Arts for video game consoles, personal computers and mobile phones in 2004. The game is a sequel to Need for Speed: Underground. Russian Russian version of Need for Speed: Underground 2 was published by Soft Club, initially with Russian documentation, and since 2006 it has been published entirely in Russian. This is the eighth main part of the series.

The gameplay in Need for Speed: Underground 2 adheres to the main aspects of its predecessor: the player will participate in street racing, earning money and gaining respect among other racers. In the sequel, car tuning features have been significantly improved, which plays an important role in the passage. In addition, the game has new features such as free-riding mode and jeeps. In the career mode, there is a plot in which the main character races on the streets of Bayview and tries to defeat a serious opponent, Caleb.

The development of Need for Speed: Underground 2 was conducted after the release of the successful hit — Need for Speed: Underground. Thanks to the good reviews and sales of the game, the developers decided to create a sequel. After the release of Need for Speed: Underground 2, like the first part, it received very positive reviews from critics. The project was praised for its interesting gameplay, graphics and musical accompaniment, but the lack of police and the length of the passage were criticized. Like its predecessor, it was also a commercial success, selling about 11 million copies worldwide and breaking sales records in the United Kingdom. Later, a PlayStation Portable version was released, titled Need for Speed: Underground Rivals.</p>
