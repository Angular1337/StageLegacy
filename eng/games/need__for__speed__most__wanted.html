            <p class="main__content__top__text">&emsp;&emsp;Need for Speed: Most Wanted is a Need for Speed arcade car racing video game developed by EA Canada and published by Electronic Arts for consoles, personal computers and mobile phones in 2005. The release of the game was timed to coincide with the start of sales of the new Xbox 360 console, the game disc was supplied with the console. Russian Russian Most Wanted was published by the Soft Club company, initially with Russian documentation, and since 2006 — entirely in Russian. The PlayStation Portable version of the game was released under the title Need for Speed: Most Wanted 5-1-0.

The game takes place in the fictional city of Rockport, where the player is given freedom of movement. In the story, the main character wins the race and moves up the "Black List" of racers in order to return his BMW M3 GTR car, which was fraudulently won by Razor. Need for Speed: Most Wanted combines street racing, as well as car tuning with optimized settings and full-scale police pursuits. To advance through the story, the player must win the Blacklist races and evade police harassment, for which he earns points, thereby gaining a rating among other Blacklist racers.

The development of Need for Speed: Most Wanted began in 2004 after the release of Need for Speed: Underground 2. The developers decided to implement police chases and expensive cars in the new game, thereby returning the series "to its roots" in order to attract a wide gaming audience. The game was announced at E3 2005. Need for Speed: Most Wanted has received positive reviews from the gaming press. Reviewers praised the interesting gameplay, graphics and sound effects, but criticized the intelligence of the rivals. Need for Speed: Most Wanted has become a commercially successful project — as of 2009, more than 16 million copies of the game have been sold worldwide, and at the moment the game has sold 17 million copies, becoming the most successful part in the series.</p>
